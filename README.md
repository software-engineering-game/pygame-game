# pygame-game
This repository is for our pygame for software engineering.

# Game Name
Space Dodgers (Can be changed if not all agreed on)

# Controls
Movement is currently hardcoded to arrow keys,
but I did put in place the foundation for keybind options in the future

## Movement
- Move up = up arrow key
- Move down = down arrow key
- Move left = left arrow key
- Move right = right arrow key
